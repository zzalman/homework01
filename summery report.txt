üìä Summary Report: Data Manipulation with Pandas

‚úÖ Task 1: Handling Missing Values

Missing Data Handling:
.Replaced "?" with NaN to standardize missing data representation.
.Dropped columns with more than 20% missing values to maintain data integrity.
.Numerical Columns: Filled missing values using the median to avoid skewing data due to outliers.
.Categorical Columns: Filled missing values with the most frequent value (mode) for consistency.

‚úÖ Task 2: Advanced Filtering and Indexing

Property Extraction:
.Filtered properties in "Richmond" with prices over $1,000,000.
.Selected "Price", "Suburb", and "BuildingArea" for properties with land size over 500 sqm.
.Retrieved the top 5 most expensive properties by sorting prices in descending order.

‚úÖ Task 3: Data Transformation & Feature Engineering

New Features Created:
.Price per Room: Introduced a column showing the price-to-room ratio for deeper cost analysis.
.Date Conversion: Converted the "Date" column to proper datetime format.
.Year of Sale: Extracted the year from the sale date into a new column "Year_Sold" for time-based analysis.

‚úÖ Task 4: Aggregation and Grouping

Suburb-Level Insights:
.Calculated the average property price for each suburb.
.Counted the total number of properties sold per suburb.
.Identified the suburb with the highest average price.
.Data Categorization:
.Created a "Category" column classifying houses as "Expensive" or "Affordable" based on the median price.
.Correlation Analysis:
.Measured the correlation between price and number of rooms using .corr() to evaluate their relationship.

‚úÖ Task 5: Exporting & Reporting Data

Data Export:
.Saved the cleaned and enhanced dataset to cleaned_melb_data_homework.csv for future use.
.Visualization:
.Generated a bar chart showing average house prices in the top 10 suburbs for quick market comparison.

üí° Key Takeaways:

.Richmond has several high-value properties exceeding $1,000,000.
.Price per room offers a more granular view of property value.
.The suburb with the highest average price provides potential investment insights.
.The correlation between price and number of rooms helps understand pricing dynamics in Melbourne's housing market.
.This structured approach ensures accurate data cleaning, meaningful analysis, and actionable insights for real estate decision-making. üè°
